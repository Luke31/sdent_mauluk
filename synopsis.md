#Theme/story
Unable to fly by nature, subjected to pain by human experimenters, a **pengium** S410 learned to be helpless. Or so thought his captors: otherwise they wouldn't have implanted the bird with an **incredible mechanic rope**!

Our hero has recognized the opportunity, his first and last chance to break free.

Alas, he is still on lab drugs: without help he is unlikely to manage the rescue rope. So be his first benevolent human! Help the lad to **escape from the lab complex**, freeing other inmates on the way.
