# Theme/story
Unable to fly by nature, subjected to pain by human experimenters, a **chicken** S410 learned to be helpless. Or so thought her captors: otherwise they wouldn't have implanted the bird with an **increadible mechanic rope**!

Our hero has recognised the opportunity, her first and last chance to break free.

Alas, S410 is still under lab drugs: without help she is unlikely to manage the resque rope. So be her first benevolent human! Help the lad to **escape from the lab complex**[, freeing other inmates on the way].

### Minutiae
- HTTP 1.1 status name of the code 410 is **Gone** (btw, HTTP 2 sends only the codes, without names; goodbye 'not found' memes?)
- our chicken (unlike her [farmed counterparts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broiler)...) can glide (like the ball already does, just need some simple animation for falling)
